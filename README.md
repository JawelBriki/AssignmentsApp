# Assignments App

This repository contains the frontend code of a WebApp to manage assignments.

## How to use
The application is available at [this link](https://jawelbriki-assignmentsapp.onrender.com).  
  
You do not need to install or deploy locally unless you wish to improve the application or debug. This application relies on a custom API, available in [this repository](https://github.com/JawelBriki/AssignmentsAppAPI).

## Key elements
- Full authentication management (login/register) with admin flag and hashed passwords on the cloud
- Guest mode and user mode (a guest may browse the assignments but will be unable to interact, a user may submit but may not edit without admin permissions)
- Clean design, easy to read and application easy to understand and use. Style changes were largely taken from existing resources.

## Video Demonstration
Coming soon

## WARNING (PLEASE READ)
Because this application runs on a free-tier cloud server, the instance may spin down with inactivity, leading to unresponsiveness both from the frontend or the backend (which can be experienced as unable to log in/register, or assignments not showing up).  
If that were to happen, I ask that you be patient and wait a minute or two before trying again, as the instance takes some time to reactivate.
